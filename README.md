# Real-time-hand-tracking
This is a Python program that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform real-time hand tracking. The program defines a class handDetector that initializes with certain parameters and methods.  

The __init__ method initializes the handDetector object with the specified parameters. It creates an instance of the mpHands.Hands class from MediaPipe, which is used to detect and track hands in the video stream. It also creates an instance of the mpDraw.DrawingUtils class, which is used to draw landmarks and connections on the image.  The findHands method takes an image as input and detects hands in the image. It returns the same image with the detected hands and landmarks drawn on it. The method converts the image to RGB format and processes it using the mpHands.Hands instance. If hands are detected, it loops through each hand and uses the mpDraw.draw_landmarks method to draw the landmarks and connections on the image.  The findPosition method takes an image and hand number as input and returns a list of landmarks for that hand. It uses the mpHands.Hands instance to process the image and extract the landmarks for the specified hand. It then calculates the pixel coordinates of each landmark and appends them to a list. The list is then returned.  The main function initializes a video capture object and a handDetector object. It enters a loop where it reads frames from the video capture object, detects and tracks hands in the frames using the handDetector object, and displays the frames with the detected hands and landmarks drawn on them. The loop continues until the user presses the "q" key to quit the program.  Overall, this program provides a simple yet effective way to detect and track hands in real-time using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
